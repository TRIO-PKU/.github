## ✨ Who We Are

> "From research to real-world impact."

Our founding team consists of passionate researchers and engineers from top-tier institutions:

![Junfeng Chen](../images/junfengchen.jpg)

- 🧠 **Junfeng Chen** — Ph.D. at *Peking University*, system architecture and distributed optimization

- 🔍 **Yuxiao Zhu** — 2nd-year M.S. student at *Duke University*, specializing in semantic SLAM and LLM-based decision
- 🦾 **Xintong Zhang** — 2nd-year M.S. student at *Duke University*, focused on motion planning and human-robot interaction

Together, we are committed to unlocking the full potential of **multi-agent robotic systems**, making them smarter, safer, and more helpful to humans in complex environments.

## 🚀 What We Do

Our mission is to empower robots with:

- 💡 **AI-Driven Perception** (YOLO, Fast-LIO, Semantic SLAM)
- 🧩 **Real-Time Planning & Control** (Receding Horizon, MPC)
- 🧠 **LLM-Enhanced Human-Robot Interaction**
- 🔗 **Cloud-Edge-End Intelligence Architecture**
- 🛟 **Applications** in disaster response, exploration, and collaborative autonomy
